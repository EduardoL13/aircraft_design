# Aircraft Design Toolkit

This repository contains a growing set of Python modules designed to support core calculations in aircraft design and preliminary analysis. The current focus is on quick-access routines for atmospheric conditions, aerodynamics, and performance estimations, with future development aimed at enabling parametric geometry generation.

## ✈️ Modules Included

- **Atmospheric Conditions:**  
  Computes standard pressure, temperature, and air density based on altitude.

- **Aero Utilities:**  
  A library of helper functions for common aerodynamic and energy-based calculations:  
  - Mach number  
  - Bernoulli and energy equations  
  - Basic aerostatic relations

- **Horizontal Dynamics:**  
  Tools for analyzing aircraft performance in level and climbing flight:  
  - Minimum and maximum airspeed  
  - Climb angle and rate of climb estimation

## 🚀 Roadmap

This toolkit is under continuous development with the following goals:
- Generate aerodynamic coefficients based on flight conditions
- Enable API integration with design software (e.g., CATIA) for parametric fuselage modeling
- Extend performance and stability analysis modules

## 🛠️ Usage

Each module is self-contained and includes examples and documentation. You can import the functions into your own design scripts or use them as building blocks for more complex workflows.
